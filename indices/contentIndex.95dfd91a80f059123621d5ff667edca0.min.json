Everything else stems from these. The Heart Definition defines the very core concepts, and the Heart Observation implies the core Alamist thought.\n\n## Heart Definition\n\nThe Am that can be named is a part of the Am. Al knows the name of Am and calls it Alam. ^definition\n\n### Commentary\n\nThis aphorism sets the stage by introducing and defining [Am](Terms/Am.md), both named and nameless. It doesn't explain what [[Al]] is, but it exists on named Am and they become Alam. With some more insight, this implies the cyclical nature of Al.\n\n## Heart Observation\n\nThe sunflower sways in the breeze while reaching for the everchanging sun. The flower drinks the sun-water and feeds the bumblebee its nectar. Flower to flower, life is spread, and Al is Alam. ^observation\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe sunflower, which can represent us, sways in the breeze of perspective, Alam and Disalam, while pursuing the vision of bliss, which is simply perspective in itself. Nature has quite a high level of Alam, and the system of sun, flower, and bumblebee is quite blissful. A bumblebee, by accepting the \"kindness\" of the flower, is helping it in return, which helps the bumblebee and the rest of biodiversity. The bumblebee carries out pollen, wisdom, to other flowers which can eventually reach for the sun as well. Everything trends towards bliss, which is Alam. Note that the sunflowers reach for the sun but will never reach it, but that in itself is Alam. There is also no mention of Self, implying Alam does not need it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-08T18:59:30.041246521Z","tags":null},"/Aphorisms/Meta-Aphorism":{"title":"Meta Aphorism","content":"\n## Aphorism\n\nArtists have the most arduous task of painting infinity. ^aphorism\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe meta aphorism sheds light on all aphorisms. It indicates that the meanings behind the words of aphorisms are infinite, and the words themselves are constraints. For people trying to interperet art, infinite meaning can be drawn, so it can be difficult but also very revealing. Often what people get out of art is not what was initially intended by the artist.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-08T18:59:30.041246521Z","tags":null},"/Aphorisms/Mind-Aphorisms":{"title":"Mind Aphorisms","content":"\n## Balance\n\nThe one who stayed indoors and the one who caught every fish starved, but the fisherman who caught a meal for his family died of old age. ^balance\n\n### Commentary\n\nThere are three fisherman. One neglected to fish, and so he and everybody who depended on his fish to survive, starve. Another fished every fish he could, but after a while the fish were being fished too much and could not maintain their population, eventually going extinct. One day down the line, the fisherman will no longer be able to catch fish, and will starve. The third fisherman, much wiser, catches just enough fish, which keeps the fish population safe, as well as their own company. Eventually, however, they also die, since everything comes to an end, but they die peacefully and naturally.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-08T18:59:30.041246521Z","tags":null},"/Symbolism":{"title":"Symbolism","content":"\nThe literal symbol of [[Alamism]] is a circle with the bottom half filled (◒).

## Aphorism

Artists have the most arduous task of painting infinity. ^aphorism

### Commentary

The meta aphorism sheds light on all aphorisms. It indicates that the meanings behind the words of aphorisms are infinite, and the words themselves are constraints. For people trying to interperet art, infinite meaning can be drawn, so it can be difficult but also very revealing. Often what people get out of art is not what was initially intended by the artist.

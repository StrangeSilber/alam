## Cooling Off

- Common sense without wisdom is ignorance; understood wisdom is common sense.
- Attachment is the root of Am, Detatchment is the root of Al. Relief is letting go, joy is holding on.
- Walking through a forest, a path emerges.

## Fresh out of the Oven

- When the world cannot be seen, it is because your eyes are not connected to your heart.
- Brush your teeth every day, for food tastes better when you can chew it.
- Through my eyes I name experience. Affected by my actions, practice calls it Alam.
- Reflexive actions are written in stone dictated by the decisive actions spoken aloud. The speech is calculated and overly flexible, but the writing is understood as the truth.
- Self control is the application of morals.
- There is no ultimate goal but living Alam.
- Mortals die and immortals are forgotten.
- Lies show truth, whether it exists or not.
- Gravity made you and made you fall.
- Powerful yet powerless, my tranquility listens to my silent words.
- Thoughts are in the brain, but the brain is in the body. You may think of where to go, but your body will take you there. Don't walk off a cliff, but don't become a stone.
- Remember the pattern of the rug on which you sit, and in the future it will help you.
- A bee may not fly without air.
- Burning your hand, and not touching fire again.
- If you are Am, you do not do anything: things are done to and from you. Thoughts are not yours, so who guarantees that they are Alam? Action is assuming a thought and experiencing its trajectory.

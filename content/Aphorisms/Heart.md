The Heart [Aphorisms](Terms/Aphorisms.md) are the core of Alamism. Everything else stems from these. The Heart Definition defines the very core concepts, and the Heart Observation implies the core Alamist thought.

## Heart Definition

The Am that can be named is a part of the Am. Al knows the name of Am and calls it Alam. ^definition

### Commentary

This aphorism sets the stage by introducing and defining [Am](Terms/Am.md), both named and nameless. It doesn't explain what [[Al]] is, but it exists on named Am and they become Alam. With some more insight, this implies the cyclical nature of Al.

## Heart Observation

The sunflower sways in the breeze while reaching for the everchanging sun. The flower drinks the sun-water and feeds the bumblebee its nectar. Flower to flower, life is spread, and Al is Alam. ^observation

### Commentary

The sunflower, which can represent us, sways in the breeze of perspective, Alam and Disalam, while pursuing the vision of bliss, which is simply perspective in itself. Nature has quite a high level of Alam, and the system of sun, flower, and bumblebee is quite blissful. A bumblebee, by accepting the "kindness" of the flower, is helping it in return, which helps the bumblebee and the rest of biodiversity. The bumblebee carries out pollen, wisdom, to other flowers which can eventually reach for the sun as well. Everything trends towards bliss, which is Alam. Note that the sunflowers reach for the sun but will never reach it, but that in itself is Alam. There is also no mention of Self, implying Alam does not need it.

## Balance

The one who stayed indoors and the one who caught every fish starved, but the fisherman who caught a meal for his family died of old age. ^balance

### Commentary

There are three fisherman. One neglected to fish, and so he and everybody who depended on his fish to survive, starve. Another fished every fish he could, but after a while the fish were being fished too much and could not maintain their population, eventually going extinct. One day down the line, the fisherman will no longer be able to catch fish, and will starve. The third fisherman, much wiser, catches just enough fish, which keeps the fish population safe, as well as their own company. Eventually, however, they also die, since everything comes to an end, but they die peacefully and naturally.

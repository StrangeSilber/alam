title: "Aphorisms"
---

The core texts that underpin [Alamism](Terms/Alamism.md) in its entirety. They are written in a way to be thought about during [Introspection](Terms/Introspection.md). Not all of their meanings are literal.

The [Heart Aphorisms](Aphorisms/Heart%20Aphorisms.md) are at the very core of Alamism and from them the rest of the corpus and all of Alamist stems are derived. [Mind Aphorisms](Aphorisms/Mind%20Aphorisms.md) are the next level up, providing practical advice through observations and others. There are also aphorisms that help understand aphorisms in general, namely the [Meta Aphorism](Aphorisms/Meta%20Aphorism.md).

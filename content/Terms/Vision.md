As opposed to "goals," Visions are ideals meant to be sustained indefinitely. I suppose visions are goals, technically.

When people think they have no goals or no purpose, they indeed have the goal to have goals. An [Alamist](Terms/Alamist.md) will *always* have the vision of pursuing [Bliss](Terms/Bliss.md) through [Alam](Terms/Alam.md).

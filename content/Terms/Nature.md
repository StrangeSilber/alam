title: "Nature"

When used in Alamism "Nature" refers to [Perspective](Terms/Perspective.md) of reality. Physics is perspective into the laws of Nature.

In science, everything is considered "Nature" and thus everything follows a certain set of laws deterministically. Science is the pursuit of a [Perspective Harmony](Terms/Perspective%20Harmony.md) with Nature.

Since there's no "truth" other than perspective, there's no such thing as "reality", however whatever is closest to that is nature.

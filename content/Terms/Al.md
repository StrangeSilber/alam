title: "Al"
---

Al is a [Perspective](Terms/Perspective.md) superimposed on [Nature](Terms/Nature.md). It is a measurement of potential to a convergent point of with a limit of [Bliss](Terms/Bliss.md). (If you think of Al as a function, it converges at infinity and the limit of infinity is bliss)

It's not numerical nor even "real", since it is simply perspective.

This concept requires [Perspective Harmony](Terms/Perspective%20Harmony.md).
The root of Al is [[Terms/Detachment]].

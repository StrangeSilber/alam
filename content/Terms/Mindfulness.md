In Alamism, mindfulness is conscious [Perspective](Terms/Perspective.md) without [Self](Terms/Self.md). This is achieved through [Meditation](Terms/Mindfulness.md#Meditation) (by definition).

## Meditation

In Alamism, meditation only refers to one specific thing: Alamic [Practice](Terms/Practice.md) of mindfulness.
In other words, the goal of meditation is to separate the Self from thought.

There are many forms in which meditation takes form:

- Sound meditation: Listen to many sounds in a busy area and acknowledge each one, as fast as you can.
- Breath meditation: Focus on the breath and how it feels.
- Moving meditation: Focus on the movements and feelings in the body.

Each of these are activities, and while doing these if you realize you start doing something else (like thinking about dinner) then try to bring your focus to the task..

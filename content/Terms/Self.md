The concept of "self" is a [Perspective](Terms/Perspective.md) brought about by what is called one's concious.
Through [Nature](Terms/Nature.md), humans have a complicated array of perspectives arranged in a way capable of "thought," on it's own capable of perspective. The array of perspectives can be thought of as a concious.

This concept of "self" is great since it allows for us to "assume" control of our otherwise deterministic actions. Just by giving ourselves a new perspective, we are able to modify the nature of our bodies, like overcoming addictions or [practicing](Terms/Practice.md) good habits.

The downside is that the self is prone to many [Disalamic](Terms/Alam.md) effects, and can often be misleading. Through [Mindfulness](Terms/Mindfulness.md) and [Introspection](Terms/Introspection.md), Alamic practice overcomes these challenges.

The literal symbol of [[Alamism]] is a circle with the bottom half filled (â—’). It represents many different ideas, including:
- [[Al]] (empty) and [[Am]] (filled)
- [[Practice]]; filling the symbol with Alam
- Detatchment and Attachment
- [Nature](Terms/Nature.md)
- Balance; More than one side; [Perspective](Terms/Perspective.md)
- Vastness of the Ocean; Perspective; Significance
- Sunrise, Sunset; Cycles; Life, Death

The Yin-Yang symbol can be related to Alamism, but is not the central one.

Flowers are a strong symbol for the Alam concept in Alamism since they appear in the [[Heart]] observation. Bees are also symbolize this for the same reason.

Fish can be a symbol of balance for their appearance in [this observation](Mind.md#^balance).
